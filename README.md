## Some projects
 #### **ISLAPP** this was one of my last university projects, and I'm really proud of it. This was created for "San Lucas Island" employers to automate the way that they stored the ilicit activities made by whoever which was visiting the island. The main technologies used for developing thi project were C#, .Net Framework, GitHub, SQL server and the architecture was "Multi-Layers". You can see further info here: Link to ISLAPP Repository.

 ``` Ruby
public void registrarReporte()
        {
        try{
            if (this.validarEspaciosEnBlanco())
                {
                    this.conexion.registrarReporte(crearReporte());
                    MessageBox.Show("Reporte registrado correctamente.", "Proceso aplicado", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information);
                    this.limpiarTexBox();
                }
            }catch (Exception e)
            {
                MessageBox.Show(e.Message);
            }
        }
```
#### **Referrals** this is a company process, I can't give too much detailes due to company policies but it's an automation which take decisions based on information obtained from Images. I didn't develop this one but I added some Improvements, one of them was consume information from GCP buckets. The technologies on this projects are:
‚≠êUipath Studio
‚≠êSQL Server
‚≠êBigQuery
‚≠êAnalytics
‚≠êGCP
‚≠êGoogle Vision.
