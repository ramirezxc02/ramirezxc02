# Projects üß®

 #### **ISLAPP** 
 This was one of my last university projects, and I'm really proud of it. This was created for "San Lucas Island" employers to automate the way that they stored the ilicit activities made by whoever which was visiting the island. The main technologies used for developing thi project were:
 -C#, .Net Framework, GitHub, SQL server and the architecture was "Multi-Layers". ![Link](https://github.com/ramirezxc02/ISLApp.git)

 ``` Ruby
public void registrarReporte()
        {
        try{
            if (this.validarEspaciosEnBlanco())
                {
                    this.conexion.registrarReporte(crearReporte());
                    MessageBox.Show("Reporte registrado correctamente.", "Proceso aplicado", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information);
                    this.limpiarTexBox();
                }
            }catch (Exception e)
            {
                MessageBox.Show(e.Message);
            }
        }
```
#### **Referrals** 
This is a company process, I can't give too much detailes due to company policies but it's an automation which take decisions based on information obtained from Images. I didn't develop this one but I added some Improvements, one of them was consume information from GCP buckets. The technologies on this projects are:
‚≠êUipath Studio
‚≠êSQL Server
‚≠êBigQuery
‚≠êAnalytics
‚≠êGCP
‚≠êGoogle Vision.

#### **DD-Bot** This is an internal bot. It helps our team to distribuite the other bots. ü§ñ
+ Process:
  1.Create a call to get current volumes and show them to the user by using the API from Orchestrator.
  2. Receive an input which are the amount of bots to assign.
  3. Send the new distribution using the API again. The technologies on this projects are: Uipath Studio,Uipath Orchestrator API, Uipath Forms, we also used json structure form payloads.

# **Automated Password bot** üòé In progress...
   This is an internal bot which will be in charge of update bots with the new password. This is necessary because we have to update more than 70 accounts 2 times per month.üò•
   This Bot interact with a internal platform where the new password is created and with orchestrator which is the place where the assets are located. This will contribute to the D2C support team.
